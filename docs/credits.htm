<h1>WoW Raid Manager Website Shutdown</h1>
<h2>What's Happening?</h2>
<p>It's been several years since WRM was a growing project.&nbsp; For several years now WRM has been in maintenance mode with it's website up but mostly unsupported.</p>
<p>At this point, the spam bots have taken over the website and the forums are no place where I would send anyone for anything, let alone for support.&nbsp; While I am not getting rid of the project, it went into indefinate slumber a long time ago and this is not changing.</p>
<p>At this point the website is going to go the same way.&nbsp; For any of you who are still using this product, I apologize for the removal of the website and the support resources underneith it.&nbsp; However, I cannot maintain it and my web host is getting a bit gripy about the size of the database.&nbsp; I don't have time to manage the spam bots nor the interest in doing so.</p>
<h2>What does this Mean?</h2>
<p>For the moment, this page will serve to direct anyone still interested in this software to the base resoures that I still provide:&nbsp; Namely downloads from sourceforge and the code base on github.</p>
<p>For anyone new to this website who has happened to run across this software as a potential solution for managing your guild raids, most of it is still functional and with a bit of database / data work there's no reason why the software can't be made to work for you, but there is no help and there is no support, this will be an "on your own" thing.&nbsp; If that doesn't suit you, you'll want to find other software from someone else.</p>
<p>There was a branch of the Github code base a while back by one of the developers who rolled on to help with the software, unfortunately I don't know if/where that branch is support wise.&nbsp; Following the GitHub link below and then determing where the code base branches are might be useful to get more up to date software.</p>
<h2>Does the Software Still Work?</h2>
<p>The most recent download from Sourceforge (Link below) should install/run on any recently supported version of PHP and MySQL - The last version of the software was produced in the PHP 5.3 days and MySQL 5.x.&nbsp; Any version of MySQL 5 should properly support a running version of this software, but you may run into deprecated pieces of code with an update to a more recent version of PHP.&nbsp; Turning off Error reporting will likely be a good idea.</p>
<p>The code base also uses the Smarty template engine and will be several versions of that behind, but that too should run on any recent version of the software, so again, none of this should keep the code from functionling.</p>
<p>There are various things (such as rollover popups on items and such) that will NOT work at this point, but again this should not cause the code to fail to work in general.</p>
<p>***SPECIFIC to Rollover Popups, there were changes made a long time ago that broke the popups to the point where they would cause HUGE amounts of data being exchanged back and forth between client and server.  Please make sure you turn OFF/disable popups in any version of this software you deploy.&nbsp;  This is VITALLY important if you do not wish to upset your hosting provider.</p>
<h2>What does it Support?</h2>
<p>The software was intitially written for World of Warcraft, I don't know if any other game/software was made to work with it, but the support is mostly there to make it more "generic" to work with other games with the same conceptual design as WoW (For instance SWTOR or potentially ESO).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sofware was discontinued shortly before cataclysm was released and I did come back to update the software (mostly) for the Cataclysm expansion.&nbsp; Since then, the software has been unmaintained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, with a little bit of database work it's likely that current expansions could be made to work with the game and potentially other games, but the last version of the software was written for Cataclysm only.</p>
<h2>Where can I get it?&nbsp; What Resources are Available?</h2>
<p>The last released version of the installable code can be found on Sourceforge (v4.1.3)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wowraidmanager/files/wowraidmanager/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wowraidmanager/files/wowraidmanager/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The last version of the software annouced for release was done by a Developer by the name of Istari on the boards who took over in my absence.&nbsp; His code was updated to 4.2 and ended at 4.2.1.3.&nbsp; While I cannot confirm this code as production quality, I'd put a pretty large sum of money on it that it's in better shape than the 4.1.3 version posted above.  You'll need to download the 4.2.1 software and decompress it first, the other dot releases (4.2.1.[1|2|3]) are patches on top of that code base...overwrite files in the base 4.2.1 download with the files in .1, .2 and .3...make sure to apply them in that order also.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wowraidmanager.net/4.2.1.zip">http://www.wowraidmanager.net/4.2.1.zip</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wowraidmanager.net/4.2.1.1.zip">http://www.wowraidmanager.net/4.2.1.1.zip</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wowraidmanager.net/4.2.1.2.zip">http://www.wowraidmanager.net/4.2.1.2.zip</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wowraidmanager.net/4.2.1.3.zip">http://www.wowraidmanager.net/4.2.1.3.zip</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally there's the GitHub for the project.&nbsp; All of the branches up to 4.1's latest listed are mine, neme-installer and neme4.2 are both development branches that I don't guarantee will even function.&nbsp; The final version (v4.2.1) may have been my push of Istari's release above before shutting down the project, but I don't guarantee that.&nbsp; It's likely 4.2.1* files above comprise a better version than what's on GitHub at this point, but again I don't know that for certain.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you've made it this far, i'm impressed and Thank You! :)</p>
<p>The software was released under the GNU GPL (v3 I believe) license.&nbsp; As per the GPL, you have the right to take this software and do with it what you please.&nbsp; If you do happen to branch the code base and do something with it, drop me a line on GitHub and let me know about your branch so I can eventually (maybe) do a pull on it, just for old time sakes.</p>
<p>I wish to extend my deepest thank you to everyone over the years that WRM was in active development who made this a successful project for the time it was available.&nbsp; While I probably won't get everyone, I'll give it a shot.&nbsp; For anyone whom I did miss, please know that I appreciate your contribution as much as those I did mention below.</p>
<h3>Thank you!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Istari:&nbsp; My right hand man in the development and support effort, Istari was the person who took over the project after I left.&nbsp; 4.2 would not have been a thing without him, the forums would not have been what they were without him, the project would not have been what it was without him.&nbsp; My sicerest and deepest thank you for all your efforts.</li>
<li>Neme:&nbsp; I know we had our differences, and I know I probably drove you off there at the end.&nbsp; I still appreciate all the work you did on the installer for the application as well as for the various plugins to support the various authentication systems for all of the CMS's and forum software releases.&nbsp; It was a thankless job and you performed it well.</li>
<li>BoaConstrictor and Spiffy:&nbsp; Two guys from the original phpRaid (and phpRaider) that this came from who eventually helped lend some software support and code support to WRM.&nbsp; Since the entire code base came from these two (initially), I'd be remis not to mention them in a thank you.</li>
<li>Finally, Everyone from the boards who ever answered a help request in an effort to support one of my users.&nbsp; A user community is the lifeblood of any Open Source project, and a good group of people providing support is what keeps a community strong.&nbsp; There were several of you who were consistent and always there to lend a hand.&nbsp; The community would have died out long before it did had you all not been around.
</ul>
<p>Finally, I'll go ahead and link the "Credits" File I maintained with the WRM software to make sure all of the historical contributions are available.</p>

<p>Thank you to Everyone!</p></p>




















Due to the extensive modifications on phpRaid and a new developer taking over the project,<br>
i've opted to go to a credits file to store all the individual contributions to phpRaid<br>
over the course of it's history.  If you have contributed to phpRaid in a significant<br>
way and feel you belong here but are not listed, please contact me and i'll be happy to <br>
add you.<br>
<br>
To begin with, Credit for at least some of this code goes out to Kile Spraggs, the original <br>
developer of phpRaid.  I should note his original copyright (&copy; 2005-2006 Kyle Spraggs)<br>
, though by GPL he doesn't own the copyright anymore, some of the work is still his<br>
original coding and he deserves kudos for the original work.<br>
<br>
Next, a big thank you to all of the various people involved who have made or brought this code up<br>
to where it is now.  A listing is included below:<br>
<br>
Individual Updates to the Code since the 3.0.7 Major release are as follows:<br>
* Version 3.0.8 Updated and fixed by Schwick<br>
* Version 3.0.9 Updated by Zeriz<br>
<br>
Foreign Libraries:<br>
Our template system is now Smarty (http://www.smarty.net).  Smarty is released under the LGPL<br>
license and thus is allowed to be distributed with this software.  Thanks go out to the Smarty<br>
people for such a robust and dynamic templating language.
<br>
Language Updates:<br>
* Alohastone for providing the original 3.0.9.2 German Translation for inclusion.<br>
* Nalumis for providing the full 3.1.2 German Translation that has been merged into base.<br>
* Nalumis for maintaining the German Translation of WRM.<br>
* Lore21 for maintaining the Italian Translation of WRM.<br>
* Litago for maintaining the Norwegan Translation of WRM.<br>
* Srshyu for maintaining the Traditional Chinese Translation of WRM.<br>
* Arrogant for maintaining the French Translation of WRM.<br>
* Marix for maintaining the Sweedish Translation of WRM.<br>
<br>
Overlib/Armory Popups<br>
Thanks go out to the maintainers of phpArmory (though now no longer supported) at the sourceforge site<br>
"mepcotterell" and "poeticdragon".  Of note, the code has been updated and extended by "Daniel" of<br>
www.marenkay.com, and is now 0.4.2.  Again, kudos to shiena of sourceforge.net (Daniel) for picking<br>
this up and maintaining it.
<br>

file.<br>
<br>
Raid Icons<br>
* A special thank you to JDDMichael from wowraidmanager.net for his creation of all of the new raid<br>
icons shipped with this release.  You can find all of his icons in /templates/SpiffyJr/images/instances<br>
and the associated directories below that.  These graphics are released with the software again under the<br>
GPL with the rest of the software and with full permission of the author.  The "source" directory contains<br>
the original work in a .psd (photoshop) format that is accessible both under photoshop as well as under<br>
The Gimp in Linux.  As with all GPL software you have full rights to modify these icons along with the<br>
rest of the software, but the author has requested that I include the original file for ease of modification<br>
of the icons.<br>
<br>
And as noted on the front page, the 3.1 and beyond code has been created and is now being maintained<br>
by Douglas Wagner: douglasw at wagnerweb dot org.  I do claim copyright for the 4.0<br>
release ( (C) 2007-2009 Douglas Wagner ) of phpRaid/WoW Raid Manager (and all previous releases
from 3.1 through the current) and the modifications to the original source contained within.<br>
<br>
Many thanks go out to my guild, Tenebrae Cor on the World of Warcraft Alleria Server for<br>
their help and testing of each new release, and specifically to "Triden" for his help<br>
and assistance on code and "Elayneff" with her assistance with RIM.<br>
<br>
Any issues, corrections, comments, or notations of omissions on this credits file should be<br>
addressed to douglasw at wagnerweb dot org.<br>
